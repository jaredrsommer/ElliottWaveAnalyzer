## Introduction

Elliott Wave Theory is a form of technical analysis that identifies recurring price patterns in financial markets. The theory holds that market prices unfold in specific patterns, which traders can analyze to predict future price movements.

### Core Premise
Market prices alternate between impulsive phases (moving with the trend) and corrective phases (moving against the trend). These movements form patterns that repeat at different scales.

## Basic Principles

### The Three Key Aspects
1. **Pattern**: The wave patterns or formations
2. **Ratio**: Price relationships between waves (Fibonacci ratios)
3. **Time**: Duration relationships between waves

### The 5-3 Wave Pattern
- **Motive (Impulsive) Waves**: 5 waves in the direction of the trend (labeled 1-2-3-4-5)
- **Corrective Waves**: 3 waves against the trend (labeled A-B-C)

A complete Elliott Wave cycle consists of 8 waves: 5 up (impulse) and 3 down (correction).

## Wave Structure

### Impulse Wave (5-Wave Pattern)
An impulse consists of five sub-waves and moves in the direction of the larger trend:
- **Wave 1**: Initial advance
- **Wave 2**: Correction of Wave 1
- **Wave 3**: Usually the strongest and longest wave
- **Wave 4**: Correction of Wave 3
- **Wave 5**: Final advance

### Corrective Wave (3-Wave Pattern)
A correction consists of three sub-waves moving against the trend:
- **Wave A**: First decline
- **Wave B**: Counter-trend rally
- **Wave C**: Final decline

## Fibonacci Relationships

Fibonacci ratios are critical for determining wave relationships and price targets.

### Key Fibonacci Ratios
- **0.236** (23.6%)
- **0.382** (38.2%)
- **0.500** (50.0%)
- **0.618** (61.8%) - Golden Ratio
- **0.786** (78.6%)
- **1.000** (100%)
- **1.272** (127.2%)
- **1.618** (161.8%) - Golden Ratio Extension
- **2.618** (261.8%)
- **4.236** (423.6%)

### Wave 2 Retracements
Wave 2 typically retraces:
- **50%** to **61.8%** of Wave 1 (most common)
- **38.2%** (shallow correction)
- **78.6%** (deep correction)
- **Should NOT retrace more than 100%** (Rule)

### Wave 3 Extensions
Wave 3 relationships to Wave 1:
- **1.618x** Wave 1 (most common)
- **2.618x** Wave 1 (strong trend)
- **1.000x** Wave 1 (minimum)
- Wave 3 is often the longest and strongest

### Wave 4 Retracements
Wave 4 typically retraces:
- **23.6%** to **38.2%** of Wave 3 (most common)
- **50%** (moderate correction)
- **Should NOT overlap Wave 1** (Rule, except in diagonals)

### Wave 5 Extensions
Wave 5 relationships:
- **0.618x** Wave 1 (common)
- **1.000x** Wave 1 (equal length)
- **1.618x** Wave 1 to Wave 3 distance

### Corrective Wave Relationships
- **Wave C** = **Wave A** (most common)
- **Wave C** = **0.618x Wave A**
- **Wave C** = **1.618x Wave A**
- **Wave B** retraces **38.2%** to **61.8%** of Wave A

## Wave Rules

### Impulse Wave Rules (MUST be satisfied)
1. **Wave 2 cannot retrace more than 100% of Wave 1**
   - Wave 2 low must be above Wave 1 low (in uptrend)

2. **Wave 3 cannot be the shortest wave**
   - Wave 3 must be longer than at least one of Wave 1 or Wave 5

3. **Wave 4 cannot overlap Wave 1**
   - Wave 4 low must be above Wave 1 high (in uptrend)
   - Exception: Leading and Ending Diagonals

### Corrective Wave Rules
1. **Wave B should not exceed Wave A starting point**
   - In a zigzag, Wave B typically retraces 38.2%-78.6% of Wave A

2. **Wave C should move beyond Wave A endpoint**
   - Wave C typically equals Wave A or extends to 1.618x Wave A

## Wave Guidelines

Guidelines are not strict rules but observations that increase probability:

### Impulse Guidelines
1. **Alternation**: Wave 2 and Wave 4 tend to alternate in form
   - If Wave 2 is sharp, Wave 4 tends to be sideways
   - If Wave 2 is sideways, Wave 4 tends to be sharp

2. **Wave 3 Extension**: Wave 3 is often the longest and most powerful
   - Typically 1.618x or 2.618x Wave 1
   - Strong momentum and volume

3. **Wave Equality**: When Wave 3 is extended, Waves 1 and 5 tend toward equality
   - Wave 5 ≈ Wave 1 in length

4. **Channeling**: Waves 1-3 and 2-4 form parallel channels
   - Wave 5 often ends at the channel line

5. **Volume**:
   - Wave 3 typically has the highest volume
   - Wave 5 often shows divergence (lower volume)

### Correction Guidelines
1. **Zigzag** (5-3-5): Sharp correction
   - Wave A and C are impulsive (5 waves)
   - Wave B is corrective (3 waves)
   - Wave C ≈ Wave A

2. **Flat** (3-3-5): Sideways correction
   - Wave A is corrective (3 waves)
   - Wave B retraces 90%-105% of Wave A
   - Wave C is impulsive (5 waves)

3. **Triangle** (3-3-3-3-3): Consolidation
   - Five overlapping waves (A-B-C-D-E)
   - Each wave subdivides into 3
   - Forms converging pattern

## Wave Degrees

Elliott Wave patterns exist at multiple time scales (degrees). Each degree represents a different time horizon:

### Nine Degrees (Largest to Smallest)
1. **Grand Supercycle**: Multi-century
2. **Supercycle**: Multi-decade (40-70 years)
3. **Cycle**: Several years to decades
4. **Primary**: Months to a couple of years
5. **Intermediate**: Weeks to months
6. **Minor**: Weeks
7. **Minute**: Days
8. **Minuette**: Hours
9. **Subminuette**: Minutes

### Degree Notation
- Grand Supercycle: [I], [II], [III]
- Supercycle: (I), (II), (III)
- Cycle: I, II, III
- Primary: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- Intermediate: (1), (2), (3)
- Minor: 1, 2, 3
- Minute: i, ii, iii
- Minuette: 1, 2, 3
- Subminuette: i, ii, iii

## Pattern Types

### Motive Patterns
1. **Impulse**: Standard 5-wave pattern following all rules
2. **Leading Diagonal**: Wave 1 or A; overlapping waves
3. **Ending Diagonal**: Wave 5 or C; overlapping waves

3. **Triangle (3-3-3-3-3)**: Consolidation
   - Ascending
   - Descending
   - Symmetrical
   - Expanding

## Price Targets and Magnitude

### Wave 3 Targets
From Wave 1 low to Wave 1 high:
1. **Minimum**: Wave 1 high + (Wave 1 length × 1.0)
2. **Common**: Wave 1 high + (Wave 1 length × 1.618)
3. **Extended**: Wave 1 high + (Wave 1 length × 2.618)

### Wave 4 Targets
From Wave 3 high:
1. **Shallow**: Wave 3 high - (Wave 3 length × 0.236)
2. **Common**: Wave 3 high - (Wave 3 length × 0.382)
3. **Deep**: Wave 3 high - (Wave 3 length × 0.500)

### Wave 5 Targets
Multiple methods:
1. **Wave 1 equality**: Wave 5 = Wave 1 length
2. **Fibonacci extension**: 0.618× (Wave 1 start to Wave 3 end)
3. **Channel method**: Parallel channel from Wave 2-4
4. **Time equality**: Wave 5 duration ≈ Wave 1 duration

### Wave C Targets
1. **Equality**: Wave C = Wave A
2. **Fibonacci**: Wave C = 0.618× or 1.618× Wave A
3. **Structural**: Wave C = 100% or 161.8% of Wave A

## Practical Application

### Step-by-Step Wave Counting
1. **Identify the trend**: Determine primary direction
2. **Find impulse waves**: Look for 5-wave structures
3. **Verify rules**: Check all three rules
4. **Check Fibonacci ratios**: Measure wave relationships
5. **Assess guidelines**: Count how many are satisfied
6. **Calculate probability**: Score based on rules + guidelines
7. **Project targets**: Use Fibonacci extensions
8. **Monitor for invalidation**: Watch critical levels

### Invalidation Levels
- **Wave 2**: If it moves below Wave 1 start, count is invalid
- **Wave 3**: If it's shorter than both Wave 1 and 5, invalid
- **Wave 4**: If it overlaps Wave 1 (except diagonals), invalid
- **Wave 5**: If it doesn't exceed Wave 3, may be truncation or invalid

## Common Mistakes
1. **Forcing the count**: Not every move fits Elliott Wave
2. **Ignoring rules**: All three rules MUST be satisfied
3. **Over-optimization**: Too many subdivisions
4. **Ignoring context**: Wave degree matters
5. **No invalidation point**: Always know when you're wrong
6. **Ignoring alternation**: Wave 2 and 4 should differ
7. **No Fibonacci confirmation**: Use ratios to validate

## Summary

Elliott Wave Theory provides a framework for understanding market psychology through repeating patterns. Success requires:

1. **Strict adherence to the three rules**
2. **Understanding Fibonacci relationships**
3. **Recognition of guidelines**
4. **Probability-based thinking**
5. **Constant validation and invalidation levels**
6. **Multi-timeframe analysis**
7. **Patience and discipline**

The theory is not perfect and requires practice, but when combined with other forms of analysis, it can provide powerful insights into market structure and potential future movements.
